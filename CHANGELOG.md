# Changelog

## 1.2.1 (TBD)

### Breaking Changes

### Features
- [#814] Implement `org-roam-insert-immediate`

### Bugfixes

## 1.2.0 (12-06-2020)

In this release, we improved the linking process by achieving feature parity between links to files and links to headlines. Before, we used the `file:foo::*bar` format to link to the headline `bar` in file `foo`, but this was prone to breakage upon renaming the file or modifying the headline. This is not the case anymore. Now, we use `org-id` to create IDs for those headlines, which are then stored in our database to compute the relationships and jump around. Note that this will work even if youâ€™re not using `org-id` in your global configuration for Org-mode.

This is a major step forward. Supporting the in-file structure of Org-mode files means that we can interface with many of its core-features like TODOs, properties, priorities, etc. UX will have to be figured out, but this release ushers in a new age in terms of functionalities.

We also add `org-roam-unlinked-references`, which naively finds text that could be references to the current Org-roam file.

### Breaking Changes

- [#701](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/701) Use `emacsql-sqlite3` instead of `emacsql-sqlite` for better Windows compatibility. This requires the presence of the standard `sqlite3` binary on your machine.
- [#750](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam/pull/750) Deprecate `org-roam-buffer-no-delete-other-windows` in favour of `org-roam-buffer-window-parameters`.

## 1.1.1 (18-05-2020)

In this release, we added two new features:

1. `org-roam-doctor`: a linting system that helps you discover possible problems with your Org-roam files. This is in the spirit of keeping notes in top quality.
2. A tagging system: one can now use sub-directories, and the `#+roam_tags` key add additional meta data to notes. For more information, see [here](https://org-roam.github.io/org-roam/manual/Tags.html#Tags).

As usual, this release comes with a multitude of bug-fixes and refactorings.

## 1.1.0 (21-04-2020)

To the average user, this release is mainly a bugfix release with additional options to customize. However, the changes made to the source is significant. Most notably, in this release:

1. The codebase has been modularized into separate files, to ease future maintenance and adding of new features (mainly by [@progfolio](https://github.com/progfolio)). Because of these changes, we had to rename many functions and variables: the old names are kept for backwards compatibility, but you are encouraged to use the new function names. You'll receive a warning when you're calling the function with its obsolete name.
2. [@kljohann](https://github.com/kljohann) did some fantastic work on graph generation: allowing building images for connected components within the graph up to a specified distance
3. We also started supporting `org-ref` natively: cite links now show up in both the graph and the org-roam buffer.

In the coming months, you can expect work on bigger projects (e.g. revamping the org-roam buffer).

### Breaking Changes
