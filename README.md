## Synopsis

Org-roam is a [Roam][roamresearch] replica built on top of the
all-powerful [Org-mode][org].

Org-roam is a solution for effortless non-hierarchical note-taking
with Org-mode. With Org-roam, notes flow naturally, making note-taking
fun and easy. Org-roam should also work as a plug-and-play solution
for anyone already using Org-mode for their personal wiki.

Org-roam aims to implement the core features of Roam, leveraging the
mature ecosystem around Org-mode where possible. Eventually, we hope
to further introduce features enabled by the Emacs ecosystem.

[@technovangelist](https://github.com/technovangelist/) has produced a video
describing Org-roam and the concepts behind it:

## A Preview

Here's a screencast of Org-roam. The `org-roam-buffer` (window on the
right) shows backlinks for the active Org-roam buffer (window on the
left), as well as the surrounding content in the backlink file. The
database is built once, and updated incrementally. The graph is
generated from the link structure, and can be used to navigate to the
respective files.

## Installation

You can install `org-roam` using `package.el`:

```
M-x package-install RET org-roam RET
```

Here's a sample configuration with using `use-package`:

```emacs-lisp
(use-package org-roam
      :ensure t
      :hook
      (after-init . org-roam-mode)
      :custom
      (org-roam-directory "/path/to/org-files/")
      :bind (:map org-roam-mode-map
              (("C-c n l" . org-roam)
               ("C-c n f" . org-roam-find-file)
               ("C-c n g" . org-roam-show-graph))
              :map org-mode-map
              (("C-c n i" . org-roam-insert))
              (("C-c n I" . org-roam-insert-immediate))))
```

`org-roam-graph` by default expects to find the `dot` executable
from the `graphviz` package in the `exec-path`.
Ensure `graphviz` is installed and found if you want to use this
feature or customize your configuration for `org-roam-graph` to use a
different tool.

For more detailed installation and configuration instructions (including for
Doom and Spacemacs users), please see [the
documentation][docs].
